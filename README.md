# Hack-Assembler
Hack-Assembler is a machine language assembler for the 16-bit Hack assembly language. This is the final project in part 1 of the course [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).

I plan to update this project soon with documentation. Stay tuned!
